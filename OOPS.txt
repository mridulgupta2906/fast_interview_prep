^ OBJECT is an basic unit that represents a real life entity, it has a physical existence and have a
	memory address location. Its properties can be seen in class.

Abstraction 	-  only showing that data which is neccessary, that is hidding unwanted info (internal 
	 	   working) and just showing outer layer.  [ done with abstract class and interface ]

Encapsulation   -  binding the data into a single unit, provides safety for the unit, from outside
		   the data can not be accesssed or changed. [ similar to data hidding what a class does]

Inheritance     -  includes superclass/subclass concept (parent-child), allows code reusability

			[ single, multi-level, herirachial, multiple (done with help of interface), hybrid]


Polymorphism    -  One name many forms,
			|_
			| compile time [ method overloading, operator overloading]			
			|
			|_
			  run time [ method overriding]
