.Python is a interpreted , object oriented, high level scripting language
.Python syntax is very easy to	understand.
.Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter (no compilation needed before execution)
.Python supports automatic garbage collection, and is called automatically
.Python identifiers (name of a function or class or variablr or module etc) can start only with
	A-Z, a-z, _  then can be followed by letter digits and _ and zero. It does not allow the use
	of @,%,$ like symbols anywhere in the name.
.Python is a case-sensitive language (ABC , abc are two different things)
.Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers −

	1> Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase 
	letter.

	2> Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is 
	private.

	3> Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private 
	identifier.

	4> If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a 
	language-defined special name.

.Python has five standard data types −
	Numbers		[int, long, float, complex]
	String
	List
	Tuple
	Dictionary
.Python language supports the following types of operators.
	Arithmetic Operators 			[+,-,*,/,%]
	Comparison (Relational) Operators	[<,>,<=,>=,==,!=,<>]
	Assignment Operators			[=,+=,-=,*=,/=]
	Logical Operators			[OR,AND,NOT]
	Bitwise Operators			[<<,>>,^,~]
	Membership Operators
	Identity Operators
.Control Statement  [ break, continue, pass]

		NUMBERS 
ex- x=1
    x=2
    print(x)    # output will be 2

functions:-

[int, long, float, complex]
x=1
ceil(),floor(),abs(),cmp(x,y) [returns; -1 when x<y ; 0 when x==y ; 1 when x>y] , max(x1,x2,x3...), 
min(x1,x2,x3.....), sqrt()



		STRINGS
Strings are immutable in python. (meaning can not be updated)
Python does not have character datatype so it is a string of len=1.
Python considers '' and "" as same, but in general '''___''' is used for paragraph strings
ex-	x='abcde'
	y=[1,2,3,'a','b','c']
	print(y[1:4])		# output 2,3,'a' 
	print(x[1:4])		# output bcd


		LISTS
they are like array in c but can contain diff datatypes.Can be updated directly by index

list.append(x)		# x is the value to be added
list.remove(y)		# y is value not index, it is the value that is to be deleted
del list[i]		# i is the index of the value in list which is to be deleted
list.count(z)		# z is the value that count is to be calculated in array (count of occurance in array)
list.reverse()		# reverse the list 


		TUPLES
This are immutable meaning can not be updated , u have to create a new tuple for it then.
tup1=(10,);	to make a single value tuple adding , is neccessary
tup=();

del tup;	# deletes the whole tuple

max(tup),min(tup),len(tup)

		

		DICTIONARIES
dict={key:value}
key is unique ; key is immutable

functions:-
len(dict)
dict[new key]=new value  # add value in dict
dict[old key]=new value  # update value to new value at old key 
del dict[key]	# removes the pair from dict
dict.clear	#clear all elements from dict
del dict 	#delets whole dict

.Python data members and member functions are stored in private heap. Its memory managment is done
	by python memory manager.
.Pickling means to convert an object in memory into byte stream to send it over a network or save
	it on a disk.
	Unpickling means loading an pickled file back into a python program
